# Continuum fitting

## Here're continuum fitting notes

### 1. NMF fitting (Zhu et al. 2013, 2016):

#### Process:
key idea:
* Selection criteria of high-z QSO analogs with both Lyman $\alpha$ and MgII emission observations:
(We may need a luminosity cut?)
	- 2.09 < $z_{{\rm pipe}}$ < 2.51 (wavelength coverage: $3600 \sim 10400 \AA$)
	- ZWARNING = 0 (avoid objects with high uncertain redshifts)
    - BAL_PROB = 0 (reject BAL QSOs)
* There are 93067 QSOs satisfy the criteria above. The results are shown in QSO_list.txt.
  - S/N > 7

### 2. Spline fitting (Bosman et al. 2017, Meyer et al. 2019)

### 3. Other methods?

## Shortageï¼š
   Currently there is no any quasar continuum prediction/fitting method can produce a good enough intrinsic spectrum for narrow absorption line studies. And, we have no method to evaluate the goodness of continuum fitting.
